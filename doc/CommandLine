Command-line input interface:
-----------------------------

Commands starting with '/' are special dirt commands (see further documentation)
You can separate commands with semicolons ';'
To send an actual special character ([/;]), prefix it by a backslash '\'.
You can create a command that starts with an alphanumeric using the /alias
facility (see doc/Alias)
