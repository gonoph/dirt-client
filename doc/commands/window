/window     Open a new window

Syntax:
    /window [-w <width>] [-h <height>] [-x <x>] [-y <y>] [-t <time>] 
            [-L <logfile>] [-c <color>] [-HB] <name>
    /window -k <name>
    /window -s <name>
    /window -i <name>
    /window -l

Options:
    -w      (w)idth of the window.
    -h      (h)eight of the window.
    -x      (x) position (column number) for the window.
    -y      (y) position (row number) for the window.
    -t      (t)ime in seconds that the window should persist.  After <time>
            seconds, the window will disappear.                    (default: 10)
    -L      (L)og file to save data sent to this window.
    -c      (c)olor for this window.  (FIXME numeric codes currently -- 
            symbolic soon)
    -H      make this window (h)idden.  That is, don't show it when data is 
            sent to it.
    -B      make this window (b)order-less. 
    -k      (k)ill (destroy) an existing window.  <name> must be an 
            already-defined window.
    -s      (s)how an existing window.
    -l      (l)ist the existing windows.
    -i      H(i)de an existing window (make (i)nvisible, but do not destroy the 
            window)

Notes:
    These are simple windows, don't have scrollback capability, and don't bind
    any keys by default (i.e. you can't scroll around in them).  They're a good
    place to put incoming tells, keep hitpoint info, etc.  See ThreeKingdoms.pl
    for an example of a graphical hpbar monitor, and help.pl for an 
    implementation of a scrolling window (help.pl implements the /help command)

    When using the -B option, unless you make the background a different 
    color, it will be hard to distinguish it from the other mud output.

    The -t option will cause the window to not be displayed after <time> 
    seconds, after which the window will still exist, but will not be 
    visible.  A timeout of zero will cause the window to never disappear.

    Commands which take the -W parameter can manipulate windows (like /echo).

    Positions (-x, -y) are measured with respect to the upper left corner of
    the screen.  Using negative values will cause them to be measured with
    respect to the lower right corner.

    Sizes (-w, -h) are absolute.  If negative or zero, they are measured with
    respect to the width/height of the screen.  (i.e. -w 0 will make the window
    as wide as the screen)

    The windows created with this command are numbered sequentially, and can
    be accessed by typing alt-1...alt-9.
