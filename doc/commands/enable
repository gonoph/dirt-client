/enable        Enable a hook or group of hooks                            [Perl]

Syntax
    /enable [-A|-C|-g|-G|-K|-T] <name> [<name> ...]

Options:
    -A          Enable aliases.
    -C          Enable commands.
    -g          Enable a group of hooks, instead of an individual hook.

    Multiple hooks can be enabled at once by separating their names with a
    space. All options are mutually exclusive; they cannot be used together.

      /enable testhook

    Enable a trigger made with the /trigger command.
      /enable -T testhook
