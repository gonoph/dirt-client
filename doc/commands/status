/status     Place a message into the status line.

Syntax:
    /status [-W <window>] <message>

Options:
    -W      Specify a window for which the message is destined.

Notes:
    Your message will be placed in the status bar at the top of the screen,
    and will persist for several seconds.  This is good for feedback on
    user-input.

    If you specify a window (-W), the message will be placed on the bottom
    border of the window.  If the window is borderless, you won't be able to
    see the message!  To clear the message on a window, do this:
        /status -W <window> ''
