/gag        Manipulate user defined gags                                  [Perl]

Syntax:
    /gag [-DF] [-g <group>] -t"regex" <name>
    /gag -d <name>
    /gag -l

Options:
    -d      Delete defined gags.
    -D      Create gag disabled.  They are enabled when created by default.
    -F      Fallthrough to allow hooks of lower priority to be executed.
                                                      (default: NOT fallthrough)
    -g      Group name with which this gag should be associated.  Multiple
            groups may be specified by separating them with commas.
    -l      List defined gags.

Notes:
    This module handles the automatic saving and loading of gags, which are
    specialized triggers that block lines of output from the MUD. It uses dirt's
    built-in /hook system to implement the actual triggers as OUTPUT hooks.
    Since these gags are simply hooks, they will interact predictably with other
    hooks.
    
    The -l option will only list gags defined with /gag. The "/hook -l" listing
    will not list these gags by default because the module gives them special
    names of the form "__DIRT_GAG_<name>", so that they will only show up when
    listing internal hooks (/hook -il).

    Multiple gags can be deleted at once with the -d option by listing the
    gag names separated by spaces. Be sure to enclose in quotes any gag
    names that include spaces.

    Gags are automatically given the lowest possible priority so that all other
    hooks are able to see the gagged lines first.

Examples:
    Gag any lines that contain the name of a player you dislike.
      /gag -t"Meanguy" gagmeanguy
