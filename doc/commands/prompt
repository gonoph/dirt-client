/prompt     Change the prompt that appears in the input line.

Syntax:
    /prompt <new prompt>

Options:
    None.

Notes:
    This is really good to use in a script, if you want to display information
    in the input line.  For example, assuming you've read your HP and SP from
    your mud, you could then run:
        /prompt HP:100 SP:58 >
