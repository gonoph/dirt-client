/exec       Execute a shell command and place the output in a window.

Syntax:
    /exec [-w <width>] [-h <height>] [-x <x>] [-y <y>] [-t <time>] command

Options:
    -w      Width of the window in which the output will appear.
    -h      Height of the window in which the output will appear.
    -x      X position (column number) for the window.
    -y      Y position (row number) for the window.
    -t      time in seconds that the window should persist.  After <time>
            seconds, the window will disappear.

Notes:
    To prevent dirt's command-line parsing system from messing with your 
    command line, place the entire command in single or double quotes, like 
    this:
        /exec 'ls -la'
