/complete       Configure the auto-word-completion mechanism              [Perl]

Syntax:
    /complete [ -m <min> ] [ -s <size> ] [ -Ccl ] [ -a <word> ] [ -d <word> ]

Options:
    -m      Minimum length of words to save.  (i.e. don't add words less than 3
            characters long)                                       (default: 4)
    -s      Size of list (number of words to remember)           (default: 200)
    -c      Smash case.  (when completing convert all words to lower case)
    -C      Do not smash case.  (when completing, leave the case of the words
            as they were found)
    -l      List current parameters and completion lists.
    -a      Add a word to the "static" completions list.
    -d      Delete a word from the "static" completions list.

Notes:
    When turned on, completion will allow you to type <tab> and have words
    filled in.  For instance, if you type 'look' on your mud, and there's a
    snufalufagus in the room, you can type 'kill snu<tab>' and the completion
    mechanism will fill in snufalufagus for you.  If there were more than one
    thing in the room that started with 'snu', you can hit tab multiple times
    to cycle through them.  Hitting backspace will cancel the completion.

    There are two kinds of completions, "volatile" and "static".  Volatile
    completions are taken from mud output.  Every word longer than <min> 
    (-m option) letters long will be added to the volatile completions list.
    When completing, more recently seen words will be completed before older
    words in the completion list.  Static completions are always there
    regardless of mud output, and are saved when you exit Dirt.  You can add
    to/delete from the static completions list using the -a and -d options.

    In order to use completions, you must have a line like:
        require "sys/complete.pl"
    in sys/init.pl, OR place the complete.pl script in the auto/ directory.
