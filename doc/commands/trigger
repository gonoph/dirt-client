/trigger    Manipulate user defined triggers                              [Perl]

Syntax:
    /trigger [-DfF] [-p <priority>] [-g <group>] [-L <language>]
             <name> = <action>
    /trigger -d <name>
    /trigger -l

Options:
    -a      Match against the COLORED ((A)NSI) string instead of the uncolored
            string.  You may include variables like ${red} in the matching 
            string.
    -c      Chance that this hook will execute.  Should be a floating-point 
            number between 0.0 and 1.0.                           (default: 1.0)
    -d      Delete a defined trigger.
    -D      Create trigger disabled.  They are enabled when created by default.
    -f      <action> is a function name to execute instead of a dirt command.
    -F      Fallthrough to allow hooks of lower priority to be executed.
                                                       (default NOT fallthrough)
    -g      Group name with which this hook should be associated.  Multiple
            groups may be specified by separating them with commas.
    -l      List defined triggers.
    -L      The argument <language> is the name of the language in which the 
            function to be run (-f) is defined.  If -L is specified, -f is 
            assumed.
    -n      Execute this hook <shots> times.  If <shots> is 0, the hook will
            never be executed (but it will be defined).  If it is negative,
            the hook will execute forever.                         (default: -1)
    -p      Priority of this hook.                                  (default: 0)
    -t      Make a trigger hook, argument is the regular expression to match.

Notes:
    This module handles the automatic saving and loading of simple user-defined
    triggers. It uses dirt's built-in /hook system to implement the actual
    triggers as OUTPUT hooks. Since these triggers are simply hooks, they will
    interact predictably with other hooks.
    
    The -l option will only list triggers defined with /trigger. The "/hook -l"
    listing will not list these triggers by default because the module gives
    them special names of the form "__DIRT_TRIGGER_<name>", so that they will
    only show up when listing internal hooks (/hook -il).

    Multiple triggers can be deleted at once with the -d option by listing the
    trigger names separated by spaces. Be sure to enclose in quotes any trigger
    names that include spaces.

    "/trigger" may be abbreviated as "/trig".

Examples:
    Make a trigger to eat some food when you see "You are hungry." on a line by
    itself.
      /trigger -t"^You are hungry.$" eat = eat food

    Make a trigger to call a function that prints some info when you see "Print
    some info!"
      /trigger -t"Print some info!" -fL perl info = printinfo
