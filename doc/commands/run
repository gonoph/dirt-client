/run        Run a function defined for an embedded interpreter

Syntax:
    /run [-L <language>] <name>

Options:
    -L      Specity the which language (embedded interpreter) should run the 
            function.

Notes:
    Do not format <name> as a function call, just pass the name of the function
    to be run.  You cannot pass parameters.  If you need to pass parameters,
    consider using /eval instead.

    If you have two embedded interpreters installed (perl/python) and you do 
    not specify the -L option, *both* interpreters will attempt to run the 
    function.
