/alias      Manipulate user defined shortcuts                             [Perl]

Syntax:
    /alias [-DfF] [-p <priority>] [-g <group>] [-L <language>] <name> = <action>
    /alias -d <name>
    /alias -l

Options:
    -d      Delete defined aliases.
    -D      Create alias disabled.  They are enabled when created by default.
    -f      <value> is a function name to execute instead of a dirt command.
    -F      Fallthrough to allow hooks of lower priority to be executed.
                                                      (default: NOT fallthrough)
    -g      Group name with which this alias should be associated.  Multiple
            groups may be specified by separating them with commas.
    -l      List defined aliases.
    -L      The argument <language> is the name of the language in which the 
            function to be run (-f) is defined.  If -L is specified, -f is 
            assumed.
    -p      Priority of this alias.                                 (default: 0)

Notes:
    This module handles the automatic saving and loading of simple aliases. It
    uses dirt's built-in /hook system to implement the actual aliases as SEND
    hooks. These aliases are intended to be relatively simple. Complex aliases
    can be accomplished using the /hook command itself. Since aliases are simply
    hooks, they will interact predictably with other hooks.
    
    The -l option will only list aliases defined with /alias. The "/hook -l"
    listing will not list these aliases by default because the module gives them
    special names of the form "__DIRT_ALIAS_<name>", so that they will only show
    up when listing internal hooks (/hook -il).

    Multiple aliases can be deleted at once with the -d option by listing the
    alias names separated by spaces. Be sure to enclose in quotes any alias
    names that include spaces.

    The first 20 arguments given to the alias can be accessed with the variables
    $1 to $20, which are replaced with that numbered argument.

Examples:
    Make an alias to get food and eat it when you type "ef".
       /alias ef = get food bag;eat food

    Make an alias to give food to someone when you type "gf <name>".
      /alias gf = give food $1
