/send       Send data directly to the mud, bypassing SEND hooks.

Syntax:
    /send [-nu] <data>

Options:
    -n      Do not append a trailing CR (carriage return) to the data.
    -u      Send unbuffered.

Notes:
    /send will never cause any hook to be executed.

    Normally Dirt keeps a stack of data that is to be send to the mud.
    Commands you type, perl scripts, etc add to this stack, and it is sent in
    LIFO order.  If you send something with -u (unbuffered), it is not added
    to the command stack, but is sent immediately to the mud.  This can be
    dangerous, since the order in which commands get executed might not be
    what you expect.
