/keypress   Manipulate user defined kepresses                             [Perl]

Syntax:
    /keypress [-DfF] [-p <priority>] [-g <group>] [-L <language>]
              <key> = <action>
    /keypress -d <name>
    /keypress -l

Options:
    -d      Delete defined keypresses.
    -D      Create keypress disabled.  They are enabled when created by default.
    -f      <value> is a function name to execute instead of a dirt command.
    -F      Fallthrough to allow hooks of lower priority to be executed.
                                                      (default: NOT fallthrough)
    -g      Group name with which this keypress should be associated.  Multiple
            groups may be specified by separating them with commas.
    -l      List defined keypresses.
    -L      The argument <language> is the name of the language in which the 
            function to be run (-f) is defined.  If -L is specified, -f is 
            assumed.
    -p      Priority of this keypress.                                 (default: 0)

Notes:
    This module handles the automatic saving and loading of simple keypresses.
    It uses dirt's built-in /hook system to implement the actual keypresses as
    KEYPRESS hooks. These keypresses are intended to be relatively simple.
    Complex keypresses can be accomplished using the /hook command itself. Since
    keypresses are simply hooks, they will interact predictably with other
    hooks.
    
    The -l option will only list keypresses defined with /keypress. The
    "/hook -l" listing will not list these keypresses by default because the
    module gives them special names of the form "__DIRT_KEYPRESS_<name>", so
    that they will only show up when listing internal hooks (/hook -il).

    Multiple keypresses can be deleted at once with the -d option by listing the
    keypress names separated by spaces. Be sure to enclose in quotes any keypress
    names that include spaces.

    "/keypress" may be abbreviated as "/key".

Examples:
    Make a keypress to get food and eat it when you press "f4".
       /keypress f4 = get food bag;eat food
