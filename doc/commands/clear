/clear      Clear a window

Syntax:
    /clear [ -W ] [ <window name> ]

Options:
    -W      Specify the name of the window.  
    
Notes:
    The -W option is only present for consistency with other commands that
    accept the -W option (for instance, /echo).  The behavior of /clear is
    the same whether it is included or not.  If no window is specified. it 
    clears the main window.
